## Important
* Currently only windows is supported.

### Switching from version < 2
This is version 2.0 of the library. I decided to increase the version of the library directly from 1.0.4 to 2.0.0 because it brings
breaking changes. The old NeatInput NuGet package is obsolete and not supported anymore.

The entire api of the library has changed so you need to make some adjustments when upgrading to 2. 

## Documentation
The documentation can be found in the wiki.
